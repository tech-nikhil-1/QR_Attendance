# QR_Attendance
   An automated attendance system built with Python. It generates unique QR codes for each student and uses a webcam to scan them, logging real-time attendance data (in/out times) into a daily Excel sheet. This streamlines the attendance-taking process for schools and classes.

# Features
  QR Code Generation: Generate individual QR codes for each student, containing their name and unique ID number.
  
  Real-time Scanning: Use a webcam to quickly scan student QR codes.

  Automated Attendance Logging: Automatically record attendance in an Excel file with In-Time and Out-Time timestamps.
  
  User-friendly Interface: Simple GUI for generating QR codes and a clear console/pop-up display during scanning.

# Prerequisites
   Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
    
  ---> Python 3.x
    
  ---> pip (Python package installer)

# Installation
   Install the required libraries:
  
    pip install qrcode[pil] opencv-python openpyxl Pillow
    
  This command installs qrcode for QR code generation, opencv-python for the webcam scanner, openpyxl for Excel file handling, and Pillow for image manipulation.

# How to Use
   
   Part 1: Generating QR Codes (qr_gen.py)
     
  --> Run the QR code generator script:
           
           python qr_gen.py
  A GUI window will appear. Enter the student's name and ID number.
  
  Click "Generate QR Code."
                
  A .png image of the QR code will be saved in the same directory, named after the student. 
          
  [ -----> " This image can then be printed or sent to the student. " <----- ]

   ***
   
   Part 2: Scanning for Attendance (qr_gui_scan.py)

  --> Run the attendance scanner script:

        python qr_gui_scan.py

  Your webcam will activate. Point a student's QR code at the camera.

  The system will detect the QR code and log the attendance.

  An Excel file named attendance_YYYY-MM-DD.xlsx will be created or updated in the same directory.

  Press q on your keyboard to quit the scanner.
